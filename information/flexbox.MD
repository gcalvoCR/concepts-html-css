### justify-content (horizontal alignment)

- `flex-end`: Items align to the right side of the container.
- `center`: Items align at the center of the container.
- `space-between`: Items display with equal spacing between them.
- `space-around`: Items display with equal spacing around them.

### align-items (vertical alignment)

- `flex-start`: Items align to the top of the container.
- `flex-end`: Items align to the bottom of the container.
- `center`: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
- `baseline`: Items display at the baseline of the container.
- `stretch`: Items are stretched to fit the container.


### flex-direction

- `row`: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
- `row-reverse`: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
- `column`: Items are placed top to bottom.
- `column-reverse`: Items are placed bottom to top.

### individual properties

- `order`: to put an item in a certain order
- `align-self`: This property accepts the same values as align-items and its value for the specific item.

### flex-wrap

flex-wrap property, which accepts the following values:

- `nowrap`: Every item is fit to a single line.
- `wrap`: Items wrap around to additional lines.
- `wrap-reverse`: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse.


### flex-flow

The two properties flex-direction and flex-wrap are used so often together that the shorthand property flex-flow was created to combine them. This shorthand property accepts the value of the two properties separated by a space.

For example, you can use flex-flow: row wrap to set rows and wrap them.
